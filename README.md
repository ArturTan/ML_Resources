# ML Resources

GitHub Repo with various ML/AI/DS resources that I find useful. I'll populate it with links to articles, libraries, and otehr resources that I come across. 


## Tabular Data ML

### General

### NNs for Tabular Data

pytorch-widedeep, deep learning for tabular data IV: Deep Learning vs LightGBM. A thorough comparison between DL algorithms and LightGBM for tabular data for classification and regression problems: https://jrzaurin.github.io/infinitoml/2021/05/28/pytorch-widedeep_iv.html

### Boosting

### Autoencoders


## Auto ML


## Computer Vision

Scaling Vision Transformers: ‘As a result, we successfully train a ViT model with two billion parameters, which attains a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet of 90.45% top-1 accuracy. The model also performs well on few-shot learning, for example, attaining 84.86% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 10 examples per class.’
